<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [IOTSC](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), working under the guidance of Prof. Dingqi Yang.

My research lies at the intersection of transportation, knowledge representation, and artificial intelligence (AI). I focus on developing algorithms and techniques that enable knowledge-driven transportation systems and autonomous driving. My interests span deep learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI, with applications in prediction, recognition, decision-making, optimization, and human-machine interaction. To date, I have published over 30 papers in leading AI and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) journals and conferences.

**Schema-Aware Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction**

Yuhuan Lu, Dingqi Yang, Pengyang Wang, Paolo Rosso, Philippe Cudre-Mauroux

**IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2024**

[**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2023.3323499)

- We propose sHINGE, a schema-aware hyper-relational KG embedding model, which learns from hyper-relational facts directly and their corresponding hyper-relational schema in a KG.

**Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in Connected Environments via Heterogeneous Context-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks**

Yuhuan Lu, Wei Wang, Xiping Hu, Pengpeng Xu, Shengwei Zhou, Ming Cai

**IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2023**

[**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3173944)

- We propose a novel Heterogeneous Context-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks following the Encoder-Decoder architecture, which simultaneously extracts the hidden contexts from individual historical trajectories, varying driving scenes, and inter-vehicle interactional behaviors.
